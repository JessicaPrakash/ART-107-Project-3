<h1 style="color:black;">Winter Mountain - Jessica Prakash</h1>

<p style="color:black;">This 3D mountain landscape painting, which was made with Blender and Adobe Photoshop, is a dream-like paradise that symbolizes the type of world I 
wish to escape to whenever I am depressed and wish to be in a better place. This piece contains mountains with some snow, a waterfall, a light blue sky with clouds, green grass and white trees
all arranged to depict a fantasy winter land. This land is full of peace and represents a world where one can escape to if they want to take some time to be away from their struggles.
Since 2020 has been a year full of hardships for everyone, Winter Mountain is the place where many would like to escape to.
